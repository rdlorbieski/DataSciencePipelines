# Data Science Essential - Call Center Marketing

The primary purpose of this project is to design a robust and efficient solution that explores various data science pipelines, tackling complex challenges in the telemarketing field.

Among the evaluated pipelines, we explored techniques for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and advanced feature engineering methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, we tested a variety of predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the outcome of a telemarketing campaign, thereby providing a valuable tool for future marketing strategies.

## About Dataset

This dataset captures comprehensive information about individuals contacted during a telemarketing campaign. It encompasses 19 columns detailing various aspects of each contact:

- **Demographics:** This includes the age, profession, marital status, and educational background of the individuals.

- **Financial Background:** Information related to any previous defaults, as well as whether the individual holds housing or personal loans, is provided.

- **Campaign Details:** The dataset offers insights into the contact medium, duration of the call, the month and day of the week when the contact was made, and historical data about the number of contacts made during this and previous campaigns.

- **Economic Indicators:** It integrates broader economic features such as the consumer price index, consumer confidence index, and the Euribor 3-month rate, which can offer context about the macroeconomic environment during the campaign.

- **Outcome:** The pivotal column, resultado, reveals the outcome of the campaign for each individual, indicating whether they subscribed to the offered product/service.

Potential challenges with this dataset include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, managing potential class imbalances in the outcome, and addressing any outliers in numerical columns. This rich dataset offers numerous opportunities for in-depth analysis, predictive modeling, and deriving insights into factors influencing the success of telemarketing campaigns.
## About Columns

- **idade:** Age of the individual being contacted.

- **profissao:** Profession of the individual.

- **estado_civil:** Marital status.

- **educacao:** Level of education.

- **inadimplente:** Indicates if the individual has defaulted on any loans.

- **emprestimo_moradia:** Indicates if the individual has a housing loan.

- **emprestimo_pessoal:** Indicates if the individual has a personal loan.

- **meio_contato:** The mode of contact (e.g., telephone).

- **mes:** The month the individual was last contacted.

- **dia_da_semana:** The day of the week the individual was contacted.

- **duracao:** Duration of the last call.

- **qtd_contatos_campanha:** Number of contacts made during this campaign for this individual.

- **dias_ultimo_contato:** Number of days since the individual was last contacted from a previous campaign.

- **qtd_contatos_total:** Total number of contacts made for this individual before this campaign.

- **campanha_anterior:** Outcome of the previous marketing campaign.

- **indice_precos_consumidor:** Consumer price index.

- **indice_confianca_consumidor:** Consumer confidence index.

- **euribor3m:** Euribor 3 month rate.

- **resultado:** Outcome of the current campaign (e.g., whether the individual subscribed to a product/service).
## Challenges

This dataset seems to be related to a telemarketing campaign, where various attributes of potential clients are captured, and the final aim is to see whether these clients subscribed to a product/service (as indicated by the resultado column). The features provide a mix of demographic, economic, and campaign-related information. Some of the challenges are:

- **Missing Values:** Columns like inadimplente seem to have missing values (NaN) which will need to be addressed.

- **Categorical Data:** Many columns (e.g., profissao, estado_civil, educacao) are categorical and might need encoding for certain machine learning algorithms.

- **Imbalanced Data:** If the resultado column (target variable) has imbalanced classes, it may pose challenges for model training and evaluation.

- **Feature Engineering:** Some columns might benefit from further processing or combination with other columns to extract more meaningful information.

- **Outliers:** Numerical columns might have outliers that can affect model performance.

- **High Cardinality:** Some categorical columns might have a large number of unique values, making encoding challenging.
